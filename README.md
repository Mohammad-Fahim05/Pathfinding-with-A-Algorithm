Methodology:
Define the Maze – Create a grid with open paths (0) and obstacles (1).
Set Start & Goal – Mark the starting and ending points.
Use A Algorithm* –
Pick the best path using cost calculations.
Avoid obstacles and already visited locations.
Check possible moves (up, down, left, right).
Find the Shortest Path – Keep exploring until the goal is reached.
Return Result – If a path is found, display it; otherwise, show "No path found."

Output:
The program prints the shortest path from start to goal in the grid.
